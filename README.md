# 🧠 Transfer Learning on Handwritten Letters using CNN

This project applies **transfer learning** with a pre-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **handwritten English letters (A–Z)**. It demonstrates the power of leveraging existing deep learning models to reduce training time and improve performance.

> 🚀 Built in **Google Colab** with TensorFlow & Keras
