# ðŸ§  Transfer Learning on Handwritten Letters using CNN

This project applies **transfer learning** using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten letters (A-Z). It leverages models like VGG16/ResNet to reduce training time and improve accuracy on smaller datasets.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Handwriting recognition is a classic problem in computer vision. This project focuses on identifying **English capital letters (Aâ€“Z)** from handwritten images using CNNs enhanced by transfer learning.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- âœ… Applied **Transfer Learning** with VGG16 (or ResNet)
- ðŸ“Š Achieved **XX% accuracy** on test data
- ðŸ“ˆ Visualized training metrics (loss/accuracy)
- ðŸ§  Compared custom CNN vs pre-trained models
